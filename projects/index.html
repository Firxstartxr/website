            <h2><a href="https://github.com/Firxstartxr/laravel-xss-honeypot">Laravel XSS Honeypot</a></h2>
            <p>This is a project I did for one of my classes at my second year of studies at university. It was a fun project to complete.
                There are some XSS challenges other students could solve. Written in Laravel. Logging is done with Elasticsearch and Kibana.

            <h2><a href="https://github.com/Firxstartxr/website">This website</a></h2>
            <p>Coded it for one of the assignments at university. I decided not to use fancy technologies which the majority of the students would most
                likely choose. Simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I like it this way. The cat is cute.

            <h2><a href="https://github.com/Firxstartxr/custom-linux-kernel-secure-boot/tree/main">Custom Linux Kernel with Secure Boot</a></h2>
            <p>Decided to explore the Secure Boot possibilites inside a custom compiled Linux kernel. It was a fun experience compiling your own Linux
            kernel and signing it with your own keys.</p>

            <h2><a href="https://github.com/Firxstartxr/openshift-nginx-keda-autoscaling-with-prometheus">Openshift Nginx Keda Autoscaling with Prometheus</a></h2>
            <p>I volunteered to help make this project during my internship at Piros. It was supposed to help the company make a presentation to one of the 
            clients. My job was to figure out how to horizontally scale a nginx deployment and find the correct metrics. I learned a lot about Openshift, Keda and
            Prometheus and also helped the team to achieve their goal.</p>
