                <div class="timestamp">2025-02-25</div>
                <p>I attended another Tech&Meet session at Howest. This time it was held by Niels Deryckere, Content Engineer at TryHackMe. He talked
                    about continuous learning in cybersecurity and how TryHackMe can help. He even hosted a private room for us to solve challenges 
                    but I was too busy with my internship tasks to participate:(</p>

                <div class="timestamp">2025-02-11</div>
                <p>It was an interesting talk by Deraeve Diederik, investigating judge at the tribunal of first instance in West Flanders.
                He talked about the challenges of investigating cybercrime and the importance of digital evidence. I learned a lot about the
                legal side of cybersecurity.</p>

                <p>I recorded a podcast with a Howest alumni Yazdan Tashiyee. We talked about our student experience, internships, job, hacker club and more.

                <h3>Tech&Meet: Google Site Reliability Management</h3>
                <div class="timestamp">2024-12-04</div>
                <p>This was a very interesting presentation about SRE from Google employees. I gained valuable insights about the 
                    profession. The most interesting part for me was when the speaker disccussed the best approach to
                    handle IT incidents like Crowdstrike. I hope I won't deal with that:( Google hire me please.</p>
