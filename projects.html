            <p>This is a project I did for one of my classes at my second year of studies at university. It was a fun project to complete.
                There are some XSS challenges other students could solve. Written in Laravel. Logging is done with Elasticsearch and Kibana.

            <h2>This website</h2>
            <p>Coded it for one of the assignments at university. I decided not to try fancy technologies most students would most
                likely choose. Simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I like it this way. The cat is cute. Sonnet 3.7 is cute as well:)
