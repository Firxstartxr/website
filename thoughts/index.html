                <h3>Hackathon AI Chatbot Challenge – Powered by NoCode-X</h3>
                <div class="timestamp">2025-03-13</div>
                <p>This Hackaton was organized by Howest University. The goal was to create a chatbot using a no-code platform. The teams were
                assigned randomly and the main goal was to help companies, which provided their data for the project, help build a chatbot to
                automate routine tasks. The real strugle was to feed the data to the agent. I took part mostly in this but unfortunately it
                did not succeed. We could not configure an option on the platform to read data directly from PDF files, so I decided to create
                a small dataset by extracting text using a Pythong script. I don't think it is the best option but it was the only idea I could 
                come up during a hackaton. Our team did not win and I think this is fair. We did not bring a lot of team effort, mostly we were 
                doing tasks on our own and someone from the team did not contribute almost anything. If I were given more time and more
                possibilities to work with (I did not really enjoy no-code), I believe I would be able to come up with a better solution.</p>

                <h3>Tech&Meet: Cybersecurity is More Than Cyber and Security</h3>
                <div class="timestamp">2025-03-04</div>
                <p>I visited this one and remained dissatisfied. The speaker was not very confident and was talking using difficult words hoping
                everyone would understand him. The photos on the presentation were all AI generated and had a lot of typos, which made me dislike
                this session even more. But hey, the company prepared some sandwich boxes as presents for everyone, so this probably made my day 
                better. Fun fact, this company replied to me regarding my internship application asking me if I could come to their office to talk
                3 weeks after I had applied and already found a better internship. We are definitely a not good fit to each other.</p>

                <div class="timestamp">2025-02-25</div>
                <p>I attended another Tech&Meet session at Howest. This time it was held by Niels Deryckere, Content Engineer at TryHackMe. He talked
                    about continuous learning in cybersecurity and how TryHackMe can help. He even hosted a private room for us to solve challenges 
                    but I was too busy with my internship tasks to participate:(</p>

                <h3>Hacker's Dan Club Session</h3>
                <div class="timestamp">2025-02-18</div>
                <p><a href="https://discord.gg/p3DjkP9PwP">Hacker's Dan</a> is a student hacker community at Howest. I promised to attend it least
                once and I did not regret coming. I had a chat with students, told about my internship and solved some 
                challenges together. They were practicing for Cybersecurity Challenge Belgium and solved <a href="https://overthewire.org/wargames/natas/">natas</a>.</p>

                <h3>Tech&Meet: Investigating Cybercrime - On the Frontline</h3>
                <div class="timestamp">2025-02-11</div>
                <p>It was an interesting talk by Deraeve Diederik, investigating judge at the tribunal of first instance in West Flanders.
                He talked about the challenges of investigating cybercrime and the importance of digital evidence. I learned a lot about the
                legal side of cybersecurity.</p>

                <h3>Howest IT Student Podcat</h3>
                <div class="timestamp">2024-12-13</div>
                <p>I recorded a podcast with a Howest alumni Yazdan Tashiyee. We talked about our student experience, internships, job, hacker club and more. 
                    <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4uMWTksNXQn6gBs6HxLdFt">The podcast</a> is cool, I promise.</p>

                <h3>Tech&Meet: Google Site Reliability Management</h3>
                <div class="timestamp">2024-12-04</div>
                <p>This was a very interesting presentation about SRE from Google employees. I gained valuable insights about the 
                    profession. The most interesting part for me was when the speaker disccussed the best approach to
                    handle IT incidents like Crowdstrike. I hope I won't deal with that:( Google hire me please.</p>
